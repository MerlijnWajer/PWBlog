About My Life
=============

*Typically this would be the page containing information about you.
At the moment it just contains information about PWBlog*

PWBlog is written by Merlijn Wajer (http://wizzup.org) and still under heavy
development.

PWBlog is a simplistic web log system written in Python, using reStructured Text
as primary markup engine. As of yet, no version has been released yet.
